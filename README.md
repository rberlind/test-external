This repository contains an example of using a data source that calls a function together with a Sentinel policy that checks the result returned by the function call. While the example here just trivially runs a shell script that returns different values based on the account number passed to it by the Terraform code, a customer could actually call an external API to capture real data and then have Sentinel check the result.
